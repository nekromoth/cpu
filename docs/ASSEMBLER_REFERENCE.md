    <int>

    0b00001111
    0b0000_1111_0000_1111       # for readabillity with UNDERLINE(_)
    65535
    -32000                      # decimal numbers can be negative
    0xFF54
    0xabcf
---

### ORIGIN DIRECTIVES
tell the assembler where instructions and data are located within file-memory. 
They are prefixed with an AT followed by a 16bit integer.

    <@> <int>

    @ 0xFFEE

### IDENTIFIERS

    Id3_nt1f13r_

    1dentifier          # invalid
    identifier$!"ยง
    i den ti fier

        <%> <id> <int>

        % VAR 0xF00FF
        set r0, VAR

### DATA
can be a sequence or integer or string literals. If needed a label can be placed
in front of the data sequence to hold the first entry.
    <id>: <int|str>, <int|str>, ..., <int|str>
